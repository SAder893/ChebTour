        <h3>Cheboksary is a city in Russia, the capital of the Chuvash Republic, its administrative, economic and cultural center. Cheboksary consists of three administrative districts — Kalininsky, Leninsky, Moskovsky and Zavolzhsky territorial administration. It is a river port on the right bank of the Volga River, at the confluence of the Cheboksary River.
            <p></p>The name comes from the Cheboksary River, to the mouth of which the historical part of the city adjoins. Cheboksary area: over 250 km2. The federal highway M-7 Volga passes through the city, connecting it with Moscow, Kazan, Novgorod, Vladimir, Ufa. The distance between Cheboksary and Moscow is about 660 km. The climate is temperate continental. The majority of the population are Chuvash. Many national traditions and language are preserved in the city — it is taught at school, all city signs and signs are duplicated in Chuvash. 
            <p></p>By decree of the President of the Russian Federation dated May 20, 2021, the city was awarded the title "City of Labor Valor." Cheboksary was also awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labor.

            <h2 style="margin-left: 500px; color: #0056b3;">The history of Cheboksary.</h2>
        <h3>The first settlements on the site of modern Cheboksary date back to the 13th–14th centuries, but the official founding date of the city is considered to be May 1469. After the collapse of the Golden Horde, the territory became part of the Kazan Khanate, and in 1551 the Chuvash and the Mountain Mari peacefully joined Russia. Since 1555, a fortress was built here to protect the southern borders, and Cheboksary district was created.
        <p></p>By the end of the 17th century, the city had become an important trading center on the Volga. In the 18th century, stone buildings and churches were built here, and Catherine II admired its beauty. At the beginning of the 19th century, the population was about 5.5 thousand people, and industry was limited.
        <p></p>After the October Revolution Cheboksary became an important economic and cultural center. In 1920, the city became the capital of the Chuvash Autonomous Region, and during the war years it worked as a rear city, where local residents and evacuees from the western regions worked. Post-Soviet changes have contributed to the recovery and development of new areas, including tourism. 
        In the 21st century, intensive construction of new structures, houses, cultural centers, industrial and agricultural enterprises began.       
        <p></p>Today Cheboksary is a modern city with a rich historical heritage, attracting tourists with its architecture and cultural events.</h3>

Plekhanov and Nizhegorodskaya Streets ran through the square, but after the construction of the hydroelectric power station, most of this area of the city was under water, and the remaining buildings were incorporated into the newly formed square.

                        In Soviet times, the Market Square underwent a global restructuring and was renamed Krasnaya. Later, the N. K. Krupskaya Park and the Children's Park adjacent to the square also became part of the square.
                        
                        Previously, Plekhanov Street passed through this territory, but when Cheboksary Bay was filled in 1996, parts of the streets were under water, and the remaining buildings along Plekhanov Street were subsequently incorporated into Red Square.</p>
                    <p style= "font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Modern dimensions: length — 400 m, width — 150 m. It is bounded by Cheboksary Bay from the north and west, Yaroslavskaya Street from the east, which turns into a transport and pedestrian dam, and capital buildings from the south.</p>
                    <p style= "font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">On the square there are: a monument to the Chuvash poet K. V. Ivanov, the Alley of Champions with the names of outstanding athletes of Chuvashia.

                <p>In Soviet times, the temple was closed for several years. By a decree of the Government of Chuvashia in 1939, its building was transferred to the newly formed Chuvash State Art Gallery. In 1943, divine services in the cathedral were resumed. The interiors of the cathedral have preserved the frescoes of the Classical era, as well as the iconostasis. The tent-roofed bell tower is typical of 17th-century Moscow architecture.</p>
                <p>There are a lot of rare icons in the temple. But the most important of them is Our Lady of Vladimir. It was this icon that was presented to the temple by Gury the Wonderworker of Kazan in the 15th century.

                <p>Cheboksary 500th Anniversary Park, although it is not considered the main recreation place for citizens (this status has been assigned to Lakreevsky Forest), Cheboksary residents who visit the Moskovskaya Embankment area like to walk along its alleys. Located on the high bank of the Volga River in the Chernyshevsky ravine area, part of the city has the most favorable ecological situation.</p>
                <p>It was founded in 1969 to mark the 500th anniversary of the city. The opening took place in early 1978. For a long time it was a branch of the central park of culture and recreation "Lakreevsky Forest". In the 90s, there was a period of decline and ruin here. But still, to date, the park has managed to regain its title as a popular holiday destination for Cheboksary residents.</p>
                <p>Currently, the Amazonia ethnic complex, which includes various facilities, is located on the territory of the park.</p>

In 1994, the Gorky Chuvash Republican Library acquired its modern name and received the status of a national library. The status of the national library has allowed us to reach a new level of development: to strengthen the role of the library as the most comprehensive array of national press and literature about the republic, to intensify work on the creation of a national bibliography, to become a methodological center for working with national literature.</p>
